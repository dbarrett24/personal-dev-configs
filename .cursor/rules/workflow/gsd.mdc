# GSD Workflow Pattern

## Overview

The GSD workflow is a 5-phase structured approach for complex tasks that require careful planning, execution, and quality validation.

## When to Use GSD Workflow

**Use GSD for:**

- ✅ New feature implementation (multi-file changes)
- ✅ Architectural changes (affects multiple packages)
- ✅ Complex refactoring (requires planning)
- ✅ Documentation consolidation (affects many files)
- ✅ Configuration migrations (requires validation)
- ✅ Any task where user wants formal planning/tracking

**Skip GSD for:**

- ❌ Simple bug fixes (single file, obvious change)
- ❌ Minor documentation updates (typo fixes, small additions)
- ❌ Quick exploratory code review
- ❌ Answering questions without making changes

## The 5 Phases

### Phase 1: SPEC (`/DS-gsd/step 1/spec-gsd`)

**Goal**: Research and create detailed specification

**Outputs**:

- `.cursor/plans/[TICKET-ID].md` with Section 1-6
- Research findings
- Component architecture context
- Success criteria
- Risk analysis

**When complete**: User approves spec, ready to plan implementation

---

### Phase 2: PLAN (`/DS-gsd/step 2/plan-gsd`)

**Goal**: Create detailed implementation plan with tasks

**Outputs**:

- Section 7 added to plan file
- Task breakdown with dependencies
- Pre-flight rules verification
- Quality gates identification
- Risk mitigation strategies

**When complete**: User approves plan, ready to execute

---

### Phase 3: BUILD (`/DS-gsd/step 3/build-gsd`)

**Goal**: Execute implementation according to plan

**Outputs**:

- Code/documentation changes
- Section 8 added to plan file (BUILD LOG)
- Section 9 added to plan file (QUALITY LOG)
- Tests passing
- Linting clean

**When complete**: All planned tasks executed, basic quality checks pass

---

### Phase 4: VERIFY (`/DS-gsd/step 4/verify-gsd`)

**Goal**: Comprehensive quality validation and issue resolution

**Outputs**:

- Section 10 added to plan file (VERIFICATION)
- All quality gates passed
- Issues found and fixed
- Build and test validation complete

**When complete**: All quality gates pass, ready for commit

---

### Phase 5: RETRO (`/DS-gsd/step 5/retro-gsd`)

**Goal**: Learn from session, improve rules and processes

**Outputs**:

- Section 11 added to plan file (RETROSPECTIVE)
- Gap analysis
- Proposed rule improvements
- Updated `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files (if approved)

**When complete**: Session learning captured, GSD cycle closed

---

## Plan File Structure

The plan file (`.cursor/plans/[TICKET-ID].md`) grows through phases:

```
Section 1: Task Summary (SPEC)
Section 2: Context & Intent (SPEC)
Section 3: Research Findings (SPEC)
Section 4: Component Architecture Context (SPEC)
Section 5: Nuance & Risks (SPEC)
Section 6: Success Criteria (SPEC)
Section 7: Implementation Plan (PLAN)
Section 8: Build Prototype Log (BUILD)
Section 9: Build Quality Log (BUILD)
Section 10: Verification Results (VERIFY)
Section 11: Retrospective Analysis (RETRO)
```

## Best Practices

**Pre-Flight Check**:

- Always review relevant `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files in PLAN phase
- Document which rules apply to the task
- Note any rule violations or exceptions needed

**Git History Preservation**:

- When deleting files, document reason in plan
- Git history preserves deleted files for future reference
- Don't remove files from git history unless required

**Plan File as Source of Truth**:

- All decisions, changes, and learnings live in the plan file
- Plan file enables recovery if context is lost
- Future sessions can reference plan files for patterns

**User Approval Gates**:

- SPEC must be approved before PLAN
- PLAN must be approved before BUILD
- Rule changes must be approved before applying

## Example: DOCS-001 Session

**Task**: Documentation cleanup (37 → 20 files)  
**Workflow Used**: Full GSD (all 5 phases)  
**Outcome**: Success

**Why GSD was appropriate**:

- Complex task (17 deletions, 4 updates, 1 creation)
- Required content extraction before deletion
- Multi-phase dependencies (extract → create → update → delete)
- Quality validation needed (link verification)

**Results**:

- Zero mistakes (no user corrections)
- Zero unnecessary questions
- All quality gates passed
- Session learnings captured in retro
