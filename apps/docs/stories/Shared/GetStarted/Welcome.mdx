# Welcome to the Component Library

This is the unified documentation site for all component libraries in the monorepo.

## Available Libraries

### Core Components (`@dbarrett24/core-components`)
Fully-styled core component library following the Hammer UI architecture pattern.
Provides base components with complete Tailwind styling, multiple variants, and full accessibility support.

### Basketball Training UI (`@dbarrett24/basketball-training-ui`)
Basketball Training brand component library. Wraps core components and adds brand-specific styling tweaks
like shadow effects, scale animations, and energetic transitions.

### Professional Brand UI (`@dbarrett24/professional-brand-ui`)
Professional Brand component library. Wraps core components and adds brand-specific styling with
subtle shadows, sharp corners, and a professional aesthetic.

## Brand Switching

Use the **Theme** selector in the Storybook toolbar to switch between brand themes:
- **Default (Neutral)** — Neutral gray palette for core component development
- **Basketball Training** — Basketball brand theme colors and tokens
- **Professional Brand** — Professional brand theme colors and tokens

## Running Storybook

```bash
# Core components only
pnpm storybook:core

# Basketball brand stories
pnpm storybook:basketball

# Professional brand stories
pnpm storybook:professional

# All stories (unified view)
pnpm storybook:all
```

## Architecture

Stories live in this dedicated `apps/docs` application, separated from publishable component packages.
This keeps packages lean and enables:
- Side-by-side cross-brand comparison
- Unified documentation with MDX
- Single Storybook configuration
- Clean NPM packages (no Storybook artifacts)
